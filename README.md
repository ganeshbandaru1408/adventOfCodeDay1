Steps: 

1. Pair up the numbers from both lists in a way that minimizes the total difference.
2. Calculate the absolute difference between each pair.
3. Sum up all differences to get the final result.


Sample solution example: 

Left List:  [3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3]
Right List: [4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3]


1. Sort the Lists: 

Sorted Left List:  [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Sorted Right List: [3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 9]

2. Pair the Numbers. 
3. Calculate Total Distance

Total Distance = 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5 = **11**
